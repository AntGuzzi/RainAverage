# RainAverage
Anthony Guzzi

This is a MIPS Assembly program which takes a given input of rain values (in feet) over each month of 10 years, and places the total rain for each year into two seperate arrays to use for various tasks. The original array is converted to an inches array first and then a centimeters array, to be printed in a table along with their corrsponding rain total and year of occurance. After this we find the highest and lowest year of rainfall, along with the number of years above/below the average rainfall (49.5).
This program was created as part of a college lab, but its input values can be altered to be used in any circumstance.
